The Transportation Management System (TMS) is developed in the SENG2020 course project. TMS is a comprehensive software solution tailored to the shipping and logistics industry. It provides organizations with the ability to efficiently purchase, schedule, monitor, and bill their cargo shipments via truck or train, ensuring streamlined operations and reduced costs.
TMS displays a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) developed using Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). MySQL powers the system's backend database. The development language used for TMS is C# which enables fast and efficient software development. 
With TMS, shipping and logistics operations can be optimized, resulting in enhanced efficiency, productivity, and profitability.
